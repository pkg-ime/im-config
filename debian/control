Description: Input method configuration framework
 im-config package provides the framework to configure and to switch
 the input method on X Window System. This input method is the essential
 mechanism for Japanese, Chinese and Korean (CJK) languages to enter
 their non-ASCII native characters. 
 .
 Many modern input methods such as IBus support not only one of these CJK
 languages but support almost all languages simultaneously by
 dynamically switching keyboard modes with GUI helper program.
 .
 By installing this package, the most desirable input method and its
 backend conversion engine are automatically configured with both the X
 Window System Input Method (XIM), GTK+ input method module and Qt input
 method module.
 .
 You can further customize your input method with 'im-config' command.
